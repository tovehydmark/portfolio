      <h2>I am Tove, a front-end developer</h2>
      <p>
        Graduating from the Media institute in June 2022, I am a frontend
        developer in the making who thrives at the border between the frontend
        and the backend. I can build a variety of applications, from restaurant
        table booking systems to games with chatt functionality, diarys, og in
        pages and more. I am foremost a React developer with Node for the
        backend, but I also use Angular. Currently, I'm learning NextJS.
      </p>
